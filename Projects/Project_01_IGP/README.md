# Peruvian Earthquake Behavior Analysis (1960–2025)

## Background
Peru is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and experiences frequent seismic activity. 
This project explores historical earthquake patterns to understand spatial distribution, 
temporal trends, and potential relationships between earthquake characteristics.

## Objectives
- Identify temporal patterns in earthquake occurrences
- Detect geographic regions with higher seismic activity
- Explore the relationship between earthquake depth and magnitude

## Data Sources
- IGP Historical Earthquake Repository
